# 1. Setup

First important thing you need to do is import the `Dialogue System` from Community Content and then drag the `Dialogue System` template into your hierarchy.

That's it. The Dialogue System just needs a database of conversations which we will setup soon.

!!! tip
	The `Dialogue System` in the hierarchy will probably show up red. Don't worry about this for now, it means there is a property that is missing a reference. We will fix this issue in a later tutorial when we have created our database.
