# 6. Conversation Entry

Next we are going to create our first entry that the NPC will say to us. We do this by dragging `Dialogue_Conversation_Entry` as a child of the `Dialogue_Conversation` script. We then set the `id` and `text` properties. Doing this will give our first entry for the NPC to say to us.

After that is setup, enter play mode and you should be able to interact with the NPC and their dialogue will appear.

!!! tip
	You can add `Dialogue_Conversation_Entry` as a child of the last entry you added. This will then show 2 dialogues from the NPC.
