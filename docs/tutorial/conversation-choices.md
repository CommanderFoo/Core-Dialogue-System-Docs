# 7. Conversation Choices

For our next dialogue with our NPC, we will add 2 player choices.

 1. **Do you have any Cookies?**<br />This choice will also have a `Dialogue_Conversation_Entry` as a child so that the NPC can respond to the players choice.

 2. **Goodbye.**<br />This choice will end the conversation.
