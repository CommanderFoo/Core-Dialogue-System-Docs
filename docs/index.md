!!! info
	In the demo video above, some advanced features like conditions and callbacks are being used to add more variety and depth to the characters. The demo comes with the system so you can try it yourself and see how things were done.

<hr>
This system was built with 3 main goals.

- **Beginner Friendly**

	I wanted beginners to be able to get a conversation with player choices up and running quickly.

	This system can be used without Lua knowledge, and doesn't require you to open up Lua Scripts to write your own conversation branches.

- **Advanced Features**

	Advanced features for those with Lua knowledge so they can immerse the player into a conversation.

	This means the same character can provide different conversation branches and choices for the player to explore based on player actions in game. This is a great way to add more depth to the characters.

- **Customization**

	The system comes with a few different themes that can be swapped out in editor and runtime.

	The system allows for easy customization of the dialogues and player choices so you can make the dialogues unique for your game.
