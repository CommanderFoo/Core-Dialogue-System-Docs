# Changes

## 1.2.0 - 24th August 2021

- Entry and Choice scripts can now be renamed so it's easier to see the conversation in the hierarchy.
- Turning off letter animation per dialogue entry is now possible.
- Abilities are now disabled when a player is in a conversation (optional).
- Entries can now have a "thinking time" which allows for the dialogue to be delayed in showing, giving the appearance of the NPC thinking.
- Conversations can now be had with static meshes (or anything). So if you want players to talk to a brick wall, that is now possible.
- Fixed: Settings for movement, crouch, mount etc were being all turned off and not respecting each property setting.
- Fixed: Event wrapper not correctly wrapping the args in a table.

## 1.1.0 - 25th May 2021

- Added support for animation stances and animations per conversation, entry, and choice.
- Added support to turn of click progress to force players to use the Next and Close buttons (this is enabled by default for QOL).
